          <div class="body-text">I've interested in game development since 2010. At that time, a game engine called Game Maker was quite popular for beginners to start making their own game. I was able to make one short 2D game with it and since then it piqued my interest to study more about game development.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I started learning Unity from 2017, on the second year of my study in computer engineering at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. Although I did not use it for academic purpose yet, I began learning Unity basics; moving objects, processing inputs, etc. The next year, I chose game development concentration that, at least in my department, focus on developing mixed-reality games.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Other than game development, I'm also interested in the world of illustration, either doing it on paper or digitally. Whenever I still have spare time, sometime I watch or read educational media, preferably contents that contain mathematics.</div>
